Kleinian and Quasi-Fuchsian Limit Sets

This app is based on the ideas presented in "Depth First C-script Listing in Colour".
I have done many little things in the process of porting it to the iPad,
but the credit belongs to the author of that code.

All the slider boxes work the same way:
* Press and hold to either side of center to affect
  parameter(s) in specified direction and speed.
* Double Tap to toggle Fast versus Slow editing.
  (Red vs Green background color)
* Triple tap to reset parameter(s).

Note: Single tap on any widget to give it the FOCUS.
      It will gain a red colored border.
      Click and drag on the image to apply the movement to the widget.
      The widgets' Fast vs Slow edit style affects the movements.

Note: Pinch the image for zoom.

A. Generator Group Select
   The drawing is controlled by up to 8 Generator Groups, with each group
   containing 4 complex values, labelled A,B,C,D.
   This selector controls which generator group is affected by the control widgets below.

B. Control Widgets
   Each generator group has 4 complex parameters, A-D.
   Each control widget controls the 'real' value via the Xaxis, 'imaginary' via the Yaxis.

C. Active
   Toggle whether the selected generator group is used.

D. epsilon
   Control the minimum size of the circles

E. Depth
   Specify the number of recursive iterations are performed.

F. Dual control widgets.
   Although it's fun to watch the circles fly around like crazy, I have yet to find a nice,
   controllable way to alter the drawing.
   These 'dual widgets' are an experiment: each controls 2 of the main widgets A-D.

G. Launch save/load dialog.
